    "description": "Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a condition where the force of blood against artery walls is consistently too high. Many people with hypertension have no symptoms, which is why it's often called the 'silent killer'. When symptoms do occur, they may include headaches (especially in the morning), dizziness, blurred vision, or chest discomfort. Hypertension can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems if left untreated.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid excessive salt intake, as sodium can raise blood pressure. Limit alcohol consumption and avoid smoking, as both can significantly increase blood pressure and damage blood vessels. Don't skip prescribed medications or stop taking them without consulting your doctor. Avoid high-stress situations when possible and don't consume excessive amounts of caffeine. Regular monitoring of your blood pressure is essential, so don't neglect routine check-ups."

    "description": "An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is an infection of the nose, throat, sinuses, or larynx, commonly known as the common cold when caused by viruses. Symptoms typically include nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. The infection is usually self-limiting and resolves within 7-10 days. URTIs are highly contagious and spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid close contact with others to prevent spreading the infection. Don't smoke or expose yourself to secondhand smoke, as this irritates the respiratory tract and delays healing. Avoid cold or dry air when possible, and don't overexert yourself - rest is important for recovery. Don't touch your face, especially your nose and eyes, without washing your hands first. Avoid alcohol and caffeinated beverages as they can cause dehydration. Don't ignore worsening symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, or difficulty breathing, as these may indicate complications."

    "description": "Depression and anxiety are mental health conditions that can significantly impact daily functioning. Depression is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and feelings of hopelessness. Anxiety involves excessive worry, nervousness, and physical symptoms like rapid heartbeat and muscle tension. These conditions often occur together and can affect sleep, appetite, concentration, and energy levels. Both are treatable with appropriate professional support.",
    "recommendation": "Don't isolate yourself - maintain social connections even when you don't feel like it. Avoid self-medicating with alcohol or drugs, as these can worsen symptoms and interfere with treatment. Don't ignore or dismiss your symptoms - mental health is as important as physical health. Avoid making major life decisions when feeling severely depressed or anxious. Don't skip therapy appointments or stop taking prescribed medications without consulting your healthcare provider. Avoid excessive caffeine, which can increase anxiety symptoms. Don't hesitate to reach out for help if you're having thoughts of self-harm."

    "description": "Back pain is a common condition affecting the muscles, bones, nerves, or other structures in the spine. It can range from a mild, dull ache to severe, debilitating pain. Lower back pain is particularly common and can be acute (lasting a few days to weeks) or chronic (lasting more than three months). Causes include muscle strain, poor posture, injury, arthritis, or herniated discs. Most back pain improves with self-care, though some cases require medical intervention.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid prolonged bed rest, as this can actually worsen back pain - gentle movement is generally better. Don't lift heavy objects, especially by bending at the waist. Avoid sitting or standing in one position for extended periods. Don't wear high heels, as they can strain your back. Avoid sudden, twisting movements or activities that strain your back. Don't ignore pain that radiates down your leg, causes numbness or weakness, or is accompanied by bladder/bowel problems - these require immediate medical attention. Avoid smoking, as it can reduce blood flow to the spine and slow healing."

    "description": "Arthritis is inflammation of one or more joints, causing pain, stiffness, and swelling. The two most common types are osteoarthritis (wear-and-tear damage to joint cartilage) and rheumatoid arthritis (an autoimmune condition). Symptoms typically worsen with age and may include joint pain, stiffness (especially in the morning), swelling, redness, and decreased range of motion. Arthritis can affect any joint but commonly impacts hands, knees, hips, and spine.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid high-impact activities that put excessive stress on affected joints, such as running or jumping. Don't remain sedentary - gentle, regular exercise is important for maintaining joint flexibility and strength. Avoid repetitive movements that strain affected joints. Don't ignore sudden increases in pain, swelling, or warmth in joints. Avoid gaining excess weight, as this puts additional stress on weight-bearing joints. Don't apply heat to acutely swollen joints - use ice instead. Avoid activities that require tight gripping if you have hand arthritis."

    "description": "Acute otitis media is a middle ear infection, commonly occurring in children but can affect adults. It develops when bacteria or viruses infect the space behind the eardrum, often following a cold or respiratory infection. Symptoms include ear pain, fever, fluid drainage, and temporary hearing loss. In children, symptoms may also include irritability, difficulty sleeping, and tugging at the affected ear. Most cases resolve on their own, though some require treatment.",
    "recommendation": "Avoid getting water in the affected ear while bathing or swimming. Don't insert cotton swabs, fingers, or other objects into the ear canal. Avoid exposure to cigarette smoke, which increases the risk of ear infections. Don't ignore symptoms that worsen or don't improve after a few days. Avoid flying if possible, as pressure changes can increase pain. Don't lie flat when sleeping - elevate your head to reduce pressure. For children, avoid bottle-feeding while lying down, as this can allow fluid to enter the middle ear."
